# When planets are in quadrantal angles

Python script to check if angle of a planet is close to 0, 90, 180 od 270 degrees and generate
image of the solar system with planets at those angles.

Purpose of the script is to find certain planet arrangements that may affect the radio signal the most, like
John Nelson wrote in his book "Cosmic Patterns".

These positions can then be compared to collected data on sunspots and radio signal strength
to see if there is a correlation.

### John Nelsons ionosphere condition predictions

Nelson predicts the condition of the ionosphere, and thus, the radio weather,
by charting the positions of the planets. He first began to study radio wave propagation
in 1946, at which time he was able to achieve 80% accuracy on 24-hour forecasts
by basing predictions on sunspot observation.
